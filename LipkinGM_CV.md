## Skills and Scientific Interests

### Scientific Interests
- Anything performance-oriented
- Bit tinkering (memory layout optimizations, performance optimizations based on memory layout)
- Types
- Operating systems
- Compilers
- Exploration of AI models' capabilities

### Knowledge of programming languages:
| Language                          | Knowledge level                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rust                              | 8/10 - can read (and write some!) libraries' code (especially those connected to type system)                                  |
| Python                            | 6/10 - can write, but not familiar with stdlib to the core                                                                     |
| Ruby                              | 6/10 - can write, but can't reason well about performance                                                                      |
| C                                 | 4/10 - can write, but not familiar with stdlib to the core                                                                     |
| C++                               | 4/10 - can write with little to no use of modern C++ features (std::vector, std::views, etc.), basically, C with classes level |
| Java                              | 4/10 - can write, but still very clunky with it, also having no proper language server setup so autocomplete is working badly  |
| BASH                              | 3/10 - can use and write basic functions, when things get complicated, prefer to stay with different languages                 |
| C#                                | 3/10 - can write on Windows, not on Linux, didn't have the experience of using libraries                                       |
| Lua                               | 2/10 - can write basic functions, when things get complicated, prefer different languages (used in NVIM configuration)         |
| nushell                           | 2/10 - can use and write very basic functions, when things get complicated, prefer to stay with different languages            |
| Pascal                            | 1/10 - can write very basic functions, didn't have the experience of using libraries                                           |
